## About me

Hi, I'm Brody. I graduated from the University of Houston with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I work as a full-stack software engineer and enjoy learning new things every day.

## What is this?

A personal knowledge Hub, a second Brain. Inspired by Tiego Forte, and using Obsidian and Quartz for the site.

### Why?

### 86 Neurons

So much information, GB of information processed daily concuisonusly, do you know what you did a year ago? a month ago? how about in the last hour?
We process so much information but fail to retain a lot of it. This is okay, because most of it is unimportant, but what happens if we miss a key fact thats important to others, a important meeting, or something that can help others?

I hate stackoverflow, one of the key reason. "You see a post from 8 years ago, with no fix, or worst a comment saying "Oh! I fixed this"

## Why Online?

Growing up on taking notes in scientific composition journal, this was a way to go back to my roots.
Inspired by Building in Public and TIL, I wanted a way to help others by documenting my path through life and growing as a problem solver.

## Ok, so, what next?

Check my Recent Writing to see somethings I been really thinking about and Recent Notes to see some sparks of thoughts I been having.

Thank you for checking me out.
