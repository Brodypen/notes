# The Basics

## What is system design

## Types of Interviews:
- Product Design
	- Design a service like x
	- What tools and trade offs are we doing?
- Infrastructure Design
	- Design a x, (rate limiter, messager broker)
	- How do we build the tool?
- OOP Design
	- Design the class for x
	- How do we design the tool? What are the usecases and what do we need.
- Frontend Design:
	- Design the frontend for x
	- How will people use the tool?

## General Guidelines to Ace your System Design Interview
- Be likable.
- Break down the problems, solve issues that may arise in a systemic way.
- Go from tough to trivial questions.
- Know your technologies, best practices, and how to use them.
- Communicate.
