## Odin project stuff

I wanted to write a success story, I used Odin Project to learn Web Development earlier on and wanted to write my story, and give out my advice!

“These are definitely still worthwhile to pursue, but it’s still better to choose quality over quantity by seeking companies that you find interesting and have core values you identify with. You will be better off sending fewer, tailored applications over hundreds of the same application in a shotgun-like approach.” —Odin Project, “Getting Hired”

No. No no no. Quantity! You have nothing to lose when applying, tailor applications for ones you are truly interested, have a master resume, (since resumes are one page).

Write Odin project success story:

Starting code with pre-AP classes freshmen in High school, took me junior year Fall to get my first internship and now finally got my full time offer I really like.  Lean into low motivation, very low attention, probably would had spent my life playing league forever and watching   (I was not the best student)

Three big takeaways?

One. Be consistent. I know this was said in one of the first posts here, but I didn’t heed the words. Consistency will make this journey so much simpler.

Two: be involved. Talk to friends, talk to others, learn in public, are things that will make you involved.

three: deal with Reject and Regret. I failed more times than I like to admit and didn’t cope that well, regret hang over me after my Meta final, I hated how I saw a DP problem for my two sigma interview, that I saw before but couldn’t fully form the piece. It’s all about getting back up.
## Reflection:

Today was a good day! I spent most of the day helping out my mom. Things I want to do better is sleep earlier. Pretty simple but it's my hardest task.
