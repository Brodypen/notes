title: January 8 2024, fix up Quartz 4!
draft: false
tags:
  - Day-Note
---

Starting with the Quartz 4 basic templates, today was focused on designing and changing some core features of Quartz to be to my ideal expression.

These include:

- Fixing absolute link '/' issues
- Changing the design, finally agreeing to go with https://toolbox.socratica.info/
  - A lot of styling changes!
  - Text
  - Margin
- Recent Notes
- Recent Writing (Inspired by https://jzhao.xyz/)
- Text shortcut buttons (Inspired by https://8cat.life/)
- Fix Code block background
- And all the other bugs that came during the way...

I don't think I'll be happy with the design, still trying to figure out how I want this to all appear.
I do like the scratch paper format.

Things for tomorrow:

- [ ] Fix social images
  - [ ] https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/features/social-images
- [ ] Figure out day note system, what to contain, or how to build in public
- [ ] Start draft of first important note, the home note.
- [ ] Add improtant links on bottom, link to repo, personal github, and linkedIn?
- [ ] Home banner
