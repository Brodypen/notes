## The New Rich

Wake up. Work. Sleep. Repeat.

This is the grind most people endure, hoping to retire at the end of their lives, if they're lucky. But what if there's a better way?

The New Rich tackles this idea of saving retirement till the end of your life, giving more meaning to your years with mini retirement and more risk taking attitudes.
