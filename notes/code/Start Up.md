## What's this?

`Solo developer, Solopreneur, Founder Mode, SaaS`

What this for me is a way for working completely for myself.

I wanted to push myself to grow while I work, and doing a side project is a good way to do that!

This is a core pillar, something I will look towards again and again.

Stay tune for more.
